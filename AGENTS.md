# Repository Guidance for AI Agents

Welcome! This project uses user-defined slash commands to guide agentic workflows. **Before responding to any slash command**, you must consult the prompt definitions stored in [`.codex/prompts/`](.codex/prompts/).

These markdown files document how each command should be interpreted. Reading them upfront ensures consistent behavior across turns.
