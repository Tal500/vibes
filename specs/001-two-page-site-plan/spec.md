# Feature Specification: Two-Page Vibes Website

**Feature Branch**: `001-two-page-site-plan`
**Created**: 2024-05-31
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "/plan this sveltekit5 website with only two pages - the index page, and a \"dummy page\". Use cool svelte transition between the pages. Write CSS by yourself, do not use tailwind. Write also testings using playwright, and plan to run them on implementation"

## Clarifications

### Session 1 (2024-05-31)
- **Question**: Should the project rely on Tailwind CSS for styling?
  - **Answer**: No. The user explicitly requested authoring custom CSS without Tailwind.
- **Question**: How many pages should the SvelteKit site include?
  - **Answer**: Exactly two pages: an index page and a "dummy" page representing a vibe-coded experience.
- **Question**: What animation expectations apply when navigating between pages?
  - **Answer**: The experience must feature a distinctive Svelte-powered transition between the index and dummy pages to keep the vibe playful.
- **Question**: What automated testing scope is required?
  - **Answer**: Author Playwright tests and ensure they run during implementation and via CI on pushes to `master` and all pull requests.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A curious visitor lands on the Vibes site, explores the animated navigation between the home and dummy pages, and appreciates the consistent custom styling that embodies the vibe aesthetic.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the visitor is on the index page, **When** they trigger navigation to the dummy page, **Then** a noticeable Svelte transition animates the route change before the dummy page content appears.
2. **Given** the Playwright test suite is executed locally or in CI, **When** it runs against the application, **Then** it verifies that both pages render expected hero elements and that the animated navigation behaves without errors.
3. **Given** a GitHub Action workflow runs on pushes to `master` or pull requests, **When** the workflow executes, **Then** it installs dependencies, builds the SvelteKit app as needed, and runs the Playwright tests successfully.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when JavaScript is temporarily disabled or transitions fail to initialize? The site must still navigate between pages without blocking content display.
- How does the system handle viewport resizing during page transitions? Animations and layout should remain responsive and accessible.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The SvelteKit application MUST provide exactly two routes: `/` (index) and `/dummy`, each conveying a cohesive vibe through content and styling.
- **FR-002**: Route changes between `/` and `/dummy` MUST trigger a visually smooth Svelte transition that lasts at least 300ms without jarring flashes.
- **FR-003**: The experience MUST deliver handcrafted CSS styling scoped to the app; no external utility CSS frameworks (e.g., Tailwind) may be used.
- **FR-004**: The app MUST include Playwright tests that cover rendering of both pages and validation of the navigation transition behavior.
- **FR-005**: A GitHub Actions workflow MUST run the Playwright tests on pushes to the `master` branch and on every pull request targeting `master`.
- **FR-006**: All interactive and animated elements MUST maintain accessible color contrast and keyboard navigability during transitions.

### Key Entities
- **Page**: Represents a SvelteKit route (index or dummy) containing hero copy, vibe-coded visuals, and navigation controls.
- **Transition**: Describes the animation effect applied when navigating between routes, including timing, easing, and responsive behavior.

## Constitution Alignment
- **Principle I – Vibe-Led Experience**: The dual-page flow emphasizes a curated vibe narrative with animated transitions and bespoke styling to evoke delight.
- **Principle II – SvelteKit 5 + TypeScript Foundation**: The solution centers on a SvelteKit 5 project with Playwright tooling, aligning with the mandated tech stack without introducing conflicting frameworks.
- **Principle III – Fluid Performance & Responsiveness**: Lightweight transitions and responsive CSS ensure smooth navigation across devices while keeping load times minimal.
- **Principle IV – Inclusive & Accessible Delight**: Accessible color palettes, keyboard-friendly navigation, and resilient fallbacks keep the experience welcoming even when animations degrade.
- **Principle V – Authentic Interactivity & Testing Discipline**: Playwright coverage and CI enforcement guarantee the interactive experience remains stable and verifiable.
