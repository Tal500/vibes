# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Document Constitution Alignment (see section below)
8. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found beyond constitution alignment: ERROR "Remove tech details"
9. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no low-level APIs, component names, or code structure)
- ‚úÖ Constitution alignment may reference required platform/tooling at a high level (e.g., "delivered as a SvelteKit 5 vibe page")
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
[Describe the main user journey in plain language]

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Experience MUST [specific capability reinforcing the vibe]
- **FR-002**: Experience MUST [specific capability, e.g., "react to user input"]
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "toggle mood settings"]
- **FR-004**: Experience MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist vibe preferences"]
- **FR-005**: Experience MUST [behavior, e.g., "surface accessibility affordances"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-006**: Experience MUST integrate with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: external service not specified]
- **FR-007**: Experience MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Constitution Alignment *(mandatory)*
Describe how the proposed feature upholds each core principle. Keep language outcome-focused.
- **Principle I ‚Äì Vibe-Led Experience**: [How the narrative, visuals, and interactions deliver the vibe]
- **Principle II ‚Äì SvelteKit 5 + TypeScript Foundation**: [Commitment to deliver via SvelteKit 5 experience without conflicting tech]
- **Principle III ‚Äì Fluid Performance & Responsiveness**: [Performance expectations/business rationale]
- **Principle IV ‚Äì Inclusive & Accessible Delight**: [Accessibility promises and user comfort considerations]
- **Principle V ‚Äì Authentic Interactivity & Testing Discipline**: [Assurance that interactive demos and validation matter to stakeholders]
